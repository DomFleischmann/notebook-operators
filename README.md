## Jupyter Notebook Operators

### Overview
This bundle encompasses the Kubernetes python operators (a.k.a. charms) for Jupyter
(see [CharmHub](https://charmhub.io/?q=jupyter)).

The Jupyter Notebook operators are Python scripts that wrap the latest released [Jupyter Notebook manifests][manifests],
providing lifecycle management for each application, handling events (install, upgrade, integrate, remove).
